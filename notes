animations in the gltf models aren't yet working.  Rob provided some hints 
as to how they got it working in sandbox.  Hopefully, its applying a few
patches.

many static assets are still not being cached because they have the session id
in the url.

the ".bin" files from gltf aren't being cached, because (I think) the loader
is setting the if-modified-since field in the request.

the videos aren't caching -- appears to maybe be related to a prefetch that
it does to validate the browser can play the file, before geting the entire
file.
