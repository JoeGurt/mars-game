methods:
  # The pickUp function deactivates the pickup and fires the pickedUp
  # event, which determines what effect the pickup has on the interacting
  # node.
  pickUp:
    parameters:
      - interactingNode

  # A pickup is an item in the world that has an effect on the node
  # that interacts with it. Thus, an active pickup is one that has
  # not yet been picked up. Activating the pickup makes it visible on
  # the ground and allows it to be picked up.
  activatePickup:
    parameters:
      - pickupActive
events:
  # The pickedUp event defines the effect of the pickup on the node that
  # interacted with it. This should be defined on specific pickup nodes.
