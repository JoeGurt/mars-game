  # Any triggers placed here will be automatically loaded when loadTriggers

  # A trigger consists of three pieces:
  #   triggerCondition: When this condition becomes true, the trigger may fire
  #   additionalCondition: This condition won't cause the trigger to fire, but it 
  #     must be true in order for the trigger to fire
  #   actions: Each of these will be run, in order, when the trigger fires

  # This holds our triggers.  For internal use only.

methods:
  # This function loops through our triggers property and creates all the 
  #   triggers, including setting up callbacks to make them fire.  From 
  #   there on out, the magic should just happen.
  # arguments: context
  loadTriggers:

  # This function takes a trigger list (like our triggers property) and loads
  #   the contents.
  # arguments: triggerList, context
  loadTriggerList:

  # Adds a single trigger.
  # arguments: triggerName, trigger, context
  addTrigger:

  # This function clears out all of our triggers so that they will stop firing.
  #   You can still call loadTriggers again if you want to recreate them.
  clearTriggers:

  # This function clears out only triggers that appear in the specified list.
  # NOTE: we do matching based solely on the keys - we don't check if the 
  #   trigger is actually the same.
  # arguments: triggerList
  clearTriggerList:

  # Checks whether we have any triggers
